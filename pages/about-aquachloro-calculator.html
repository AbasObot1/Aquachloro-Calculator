            <h2>All you need to know </h2>
            <p>Aquachloro calculator is a tool designed by Abasiama Akpan (Abas Obot) for the calculation of
                chlorine related parameters in water industries. It was primarily intended as a general
                estimation tool to assist with pool and spa chlorine  treatment calculations, as well
                water packaging companies for raw water disinfection through chlorination.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tool employees the principle of water treatment through chlorination for its functionalities,
                however, it is good to read the disclaimer before using it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another key factor to consider while using Aquachloro calculator is that it focuese more on solid
                chlorine compounds, mainly high-test calcium hypochlorite which exist in solid powder or pellets.
                If your raw chlorine is in liquid form, the developer is working on a tool to handle it.

            <h2>Features of Aquachloro Calculator</h2>
            <p>Currently, this tool has two features as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Chlorine dose calculator:
                        <p>This feature is used to calculate the mass of raw chlorine needed to obtain a desired concentration in water.
                            It is mostly useful when you know the concentration in ppm or mg/L that you want to achieve.
                            The chlorine chlorine-dose-calculator will help you to know the exact mass (g) to measure into the raw
                            water container.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>chlorine-concentration-calculator:
                        This feaature allows you to know the exact concentration of pure chlorine in water aafter adding
                        a measured amount into the tank. The concentration is given in ppm which is same as mg/L.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h2>My misson</h2>
            <p>I have worked in the water industry. One of the thing that bothered me was that we had to do
                calculations here and there each time we wanted to treat water, at least in most cases.
                There are many tools out there to make these calculations easier, only that some of them are 
                not dependable. Also, many of such tools focus on gallon, cubic meter, oz, instead of litre, gram
                and mg/L unites popular in countries like Nigeria. This means that one would had to go through
                a lot of unnecessary calculations before arriving at an answer. Besides, those tools also focus on
                large volumes of water like spa. Therefore, after learning coding, it has always been on my mind to
                bring this solution: a tool that calculates, simplifies, and gives answer in the language 
                people in my locality can understand. It has to be user-friendly and simple design.
                That is how Aquachloro Calculator came to be.
            </p>
            <p>This tool is still under development. If you have suggestions to make, feel free to <a href="https://abasobot1.github.io/abasiama-akpan">contact me</a></p>
